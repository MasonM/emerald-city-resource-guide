# [Emerald City Resource Guide](http://www.emeraldcityresourceguide.org/)

The Emerald City Resource Guide (ECRG, [http://www.emeraldcityresourceguide.org/](http://www.emeraldcityresourceguide.org/)) is a directory of social service organizations located in Seattle.  The first hard copy of the guide was published by local non-profit, [Real Change](https://www.realchangenews.org/), in April, 2018, in the hopes of providing an easy reference guide for individuals who may not have access to a computer. v1 of the online version of the guide was released in January, 2019, with the intention of providing the means for updating the guide on a more frequent basis and a creating a dynamic UI for those with access to the internet.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up a local development environment:
1. Install [docker and docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Create a file named `.env` in your clone of this repository with two lines, one setting `FIREBASE_CONFIG` and one setting `GOOGLE_CONFIG`. Copy-and-paste the values from https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/emerald-city-guide/settings, but make sure to remove newlines.

    ```
    FIREBASE_CONFIG={ apiKey...
    GOOGLE_CONFIG={ "type":...
    ```

3. Install dependencies and set up the DB with `docker-compose run --rm node sh -c "npm install && npm run db:init"`
4. Launch the server with `docker-compose up` and visit http://localhost:8080/

## Testing
Local testing is conducted using mocha and chai. Run the tests using `docker-compose run --rm node npm run test`

The test file within this repo is intended to cover the server methods that transform the user inputs in the search form into a SQL query and then retrieves the corresponding records from the database.

## Production
To access the production database hosted by Heroku, run `heroku pg:psql -â€”app emerald-city-guide` from within CLI and follow login prompts as directed (this is assuming that you have been added as a collaborator to the site on Heroku).

## Upcoming Features

## Built With
